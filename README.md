# Weather-Forecaster
### 1.Description: 
This is a fully functional weather app that uses openweather api to add functionality to the page. When I search for a city, then I am presented with the current weather and a 5 day forecast that also contains the high and low estimated temperatures for the forecasted days. My search results save to local storage. A clear button was also added so that the user can clear local storage manually. When I click one of the prior search results, that city's current information is displayed again.

### 2.My Role:
I am the sole developer and creator of the project. I am responsible for all of the functionality and meeting the user story and acceptance criteria that I was presented. I also adjusted the design of the page to be more aesthetically pleasing.
